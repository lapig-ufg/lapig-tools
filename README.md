# lapig-tools
A toolbox plugin for QGIS
LAPIG Tools is a tool set in order to analyze geographic information and process satellite images (satellite, UAV's):
  - Calculate area in region (Tool): In experimental character, this tool calculates for each record, the area of each feature you want.A following options:
     * Choose the shape folder for extracting area: Folder that contains the shapes files you want to calculate area;
     * Select the shape to calculate region: The shapes of the region file you want to abstract the area
     * Set the output shape: The shape file output (same to Select the shape to calculate region)
     * Unit to calculate region: Mediated drive you want to calculate the area.

The LAPIG Tools future will be inserted classification tools using the "Random Forest" algorithm among other tools to analyze Spatial and digital image processing.
